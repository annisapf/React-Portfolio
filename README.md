# React-Portfolio
This is a *React Portfolio* contains 3 pages : About, Portfolio, Contact, made in React.

## Goal
Bootstrap helps a developer to build a responsive website since React allows developers to create reusable components that are independent of each other. React shines in building dynamic and engaging web interfaces.
In addition, building a responsive portfolio using React as a website developer is helpful in showcasing our skills and experiences specially if we are actively looking for a new opportunity. The portfolio is showing our unique style and a collection of projects or past works that would (hopefully) lead to a job offer.
